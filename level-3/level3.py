# Warning
# All following functions can take up to 3 arguments as input but should only return one value as output

# Exercise 1 (easy)
# Implement the following function get_circle_area
# input: a number R representing the radius of a given circle
# output: a float equals to the area of a circle which radius is R
# restrictions / hint : you must use a library

def get_circle_area(R):
    return 0

# Test your code for exercise 1
print(get_circle_area(2)) # 6.28
print(get_circle_area(3)) # 28.27



# Exercise 2.1 (medium)
# Implement the following function reverse_names
# input: two strings representing a first name and a last name
# output: the same two strings reversed
# restrictions: you must use the .reverse built in Python's method

def reverse_names(firstName, lastName):
    return 0

# Test your code here for exercise 2.1
print(reverse_names("julien", "colombain")) # neiluj niabmoloc
print(reverse_names("alexandre", "jallet")) # erdnaxela tellaj



# Exercise 2.2 (hard)
# Implement the following function reverse_names
# input: two strings representing a first name and a last name
# output: the same two strings reversed
# restrictions: you must not use the .reverse built in Python's method but build it yourself

def my_reverse_names(firstName, lastName):
    return 0

# Test your code here for exercise 2.2
print(my_reverse_names("julien", "colombain")) # neiluj niabmoloc
print(my_reverse_names("alexandre", "jallet")) # erdnaxela tellaj
