# Python exercises
Whether you are a brand new developer or an intermediate one who wants to sharpen his skills, follow my set of exercises and become a python beast!

# Setup a python environment
Download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (chose the latest version) <br/>
Install spyder IDE [here](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) (chose the latest version) <br/>
clone this repository and start coding
```bash
git clone git@github.com:juliencol/python-exercises.git
```

# About the exercises
The exercises are divided into different levels. Each level contains between 2 and 6 exercises, following a growing difficulty. <br/>
For each exercise, you're given a function to implement with a given input and a desired output. Your goal is to come up with good code that satisfy the result. You can test any function by copying the code written under the section "Test your code" and paste it in the spyder console. <br/>
Try to find the results by yourself before looking at the correction.

# Problem solving approach
Step 1: take time to understand the problem <br/>
Step 2: use concrete examples to expect precise outputs <br/>
Step 3: break down the problem into small pieces <br/>
Step 4: solve the problem, piece by piece <br/>
Step 5: look back and refactor your code <br/>
